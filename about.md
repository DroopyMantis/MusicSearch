My app uses the itunes API to display lists of songs and artists based on a search input. You can click on any song to see a more detailed view and another list of anything else in the album. At any point the user can type in another search
or go back to previous searches. The user can also click a help button to see how to use the app. The API used is perform searches with the Itunes data and the documentation can be found here. https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api
